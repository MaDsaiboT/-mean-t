# An integreation of THREE.js into the MEAN stack

## General information
This project is set up as a learning-by-doing experience for me and others who want to participate.

The general purpose of mean-pluss-three is to provide a boilerplate that acts as basis for development of 3D browsergames with basic social- and multiplayer features build in.

Utilising: 
* MongoDB to store data persistently on the server
* Express.js to provide APIs and serverside game logic,
* Angular to build the frontend/user-interface and interact with APIs
* Node.js as the actual server for event driven 2-way-comunication 
* pluss
* THREE.js to create and render 3D game enviroments (scenes)

## First milestone
* setup a basic file/folder structure that is easy to understand for   devs of all levels of experience and mostly compliant to   standards/best-practices
* get all dependencies in order
* get server-side Typescript running 
* mock registraion & login functionality in server/api
* mock registraion & login functionality in client
* have a nice animation in the canvas so that something actualy moves in the background
* find someone who wants to take care of my bad spelling
* use githubs build in features to organise milestones
